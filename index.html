The book includes stickers and well-designed activities to help kids understand composting. My favorite page is page 29 where there is a spinning wheel to see which organic waste can be composted and which cannot. There is also a cute Worms and Ladders board game included in the book. Overall, I recommend this book for families with kids age 10 and younger.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Composting-Basics-Skills-Tools-Started/dp/0811718379/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582768236051000">https://www.amazon.com/Composting-Basics-Skills-Tools-Started/dp/0811718379/</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This book provides the most graphic and detailed steps on how to build a three-bin compost system. The pictures are clear, down-to-earth, no-filter and helpful. If you are a visual learner, this book will be helpful to walk you through all the basics, how to build bins, what are the various tools, how to collect worm castings, etc.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Let-Rot-Composting-Down-Earth/dp/1580170234/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582768236051000">https://www.amazon.com/Let-Rot-Composting-Down-Earth/dp/1580170234/</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This book is wordy, in a good way if you genuinely want to understand the nitty gritty behind how each piece of the compost puzzle works. I imagine some people find all the texts in this book off putting. I enjoyed reading this book because it presented different composting method in details, it explains how decomposition works. If I like reading text and am only buying one book for composting, I&rsquo;d get this one.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Composting-New-Generation-Latest-Techniques/dp/1591866928/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582768236052000">https://www.amazon.com/Composting-New-Generation-Latest-Techniques/dp/1591866928/</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This book has a competent editor. The materials are presented methodologically. The pictures are big and clear. The text is in clear sections. The page designs are much more modern compared to other compost books. If there is any complaint, it would be that the book is too big and heavy. This book is suitable for graphic learners who wants easy access to detail explanations at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Compost-forma-natural-preparar-huerto/dp/8480768258/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582768236052000">https://www.amazon.com/Compost-forma-natural-preparar-huerto/dp/8480768258/</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This book feels more like a coffee table book.

The first half of the book aim to combat people&rsquo;s hesitation about composting in a more dense living area.

Many of the compost books show compost piles as this perfect fluffy uniform earth-colored piles ready for a photoshoot. This book is different.

I like that this book is very comprehensive and offer both width and depth on the subject. This is the book that I aspire to read word-for-word every page. But to be honest, it will end up being that book I will aspire to read but forever left on the book shelf.

The first time I read this book, I did it out of curiosity of how to scale a composting operation. The second time i read this book, I had just came back from a tour at Maryland Organic Composting facility where they could process up to 32,500 tons of compost a year. The first time I was fascinated. The second time, I was impressed, by the knowledge and how pragmatic the book was written. Highly recommend this book if you want to learn how to recycle organics at the community scale. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Want to Read</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Handbook-Compost-Engineering&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582768236056000">https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Handbook-Compost-Engineering</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Industrial-Composting-Environmental-Engineering-Facilities/dp/143984531X/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582768236057000">https://www.amazon.com/Industrial-Composting-Environmental-Engineering-Facilities/dp/143984531X/</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/6moJR1a_T8cC&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582768236057000">https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/6moJR1a_T8cC</a></span></p></body></html>
